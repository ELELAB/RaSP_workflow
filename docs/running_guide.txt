###THIS FILE AIMS TO DESCRIBE HOW TO RUN
###THE RASP WORKFLOW.

#CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: 

# Activate envrionment
# running 
# flags (for running) 
# Examples of runs

########### ACTIVATE ENVIRONMENT ###############
#see installation_guide.txt to set up environment.
#Bioinfo01
module load conda/4.9.2/modulefile
conda activate rasp

#Bioinfo03 and 04
/usr/local/miniconda3/bin/conda
conda activate rasp

#activaton depends on your personal environment.

########### RUNNING ##############

RaSP_workflow [flags]

########## FLAGS ##################
# -n [CORES]

# This number will limit the number of cores
# if you do not do this, all available cores
# will be used. If you do not specify only one
# core will be used.

#ex. -n 4
#ex. -n 8

# -t [INPUT TYPE]

#There are three modes of running RaSP:
#        1) with a uniprot id to download the AlphaFold model
#        2) with a PDB id to download a PDB model
#        3) with a file name to run RaSP on an existing PDB file.

#In each case, this should be defined with the input type [-t].
# ex. -t FILE for an existing pdb file.
# ex. -t AF to download a new Alphafold Sturcture
# ex. -t PDB to download a new PDB structure.

#Per default FILE is used, hence you can ommit this flag if you use an existing file.

# -i [INPUT FILE]

#There are three modes of running RaSP:
#       1) with a uniprot id to download the AlphaFold model
#       2) with a PDB id to download a PDB model
#       3) with a file name to run RaSP on an existing PDB file.

#This is defined using the flag [-i] input pdb
# ex.  -i P62942 for the alphafold model
# ex.  -i 2XWR for the pdb model
# ex.  -i 2PPN.pdb for an existing structure. 

# -c [CHAIN NAME]

# RaSP can only take one chain at a time as input. The chain name 
# should be defined using -c chain. 

# ex. -c A
# ex. -c B

# -v [ALPHAFOLD VERSION]

# When an AlphaFold model is downloaded the version can be defined 
# using the -v version flag. This is optional. Per default version 4. 

# -r [RUNTYPE]

# RaSP have two runtypes, cpu and cuda. Cuda is a gpu type. 
# When running on bioinfo01 always use cpu or leave the flag
# out since the default is cpu. When running on bioinfo03 or 04 
# use cuda, since this will speed up the process. 

#-p [PATH]

# The src directory containing the scripts, model and all additional
# data, can be specified using the command -p. Per default this is
# ./src, but can be changed to any other path. 

############ EXAMPLES #######################

#ALPHAFOLD MODELS
RaSP_workflow -n 4 -i P62942 -c A -v 4 -r cpu

#Alternatively on bioinfo03 or 04

RaSP_workflow -n 4 -i P62942 -c A -r cuda

#PDB ID
RaSP_workflow -n 4 -i 2XWR -c B -r cuda

#EXISTING PDB
RaSP_workflow -n 4 -i trimmed_ulk1.pdb -c A -r cuda
#NOTICE that the pdb should be in the working directory
#or in data/input.
